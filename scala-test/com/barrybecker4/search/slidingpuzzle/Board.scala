/**
  * Immutable.
  *
  * Here is a list of performance enhancements that I made and how important they are:
  * - calculated the chang in the manhattan distance in the constructor, and cache it in a private property.
  * - use lazy calculation of the hamming distance. IOW, calculate the first time requested and cache it.
  * - made blocks use byte instead of int. short is probably best.
  * - use a 1D array instead of a 2D array for the blocks.
  * - Calculate the stringForm (from toString) in the constructor and cache it.
  * This should not be needed, and is bad because it adds memory. But I needed it in order to use the stringForm
  * as a hashcode for use in a HashMap (that also should not be needed, but I could not get reasonable times without)
  * - Use hamming distance as a sort of hashcode in the equals method to speed it up, since the normal way of computing
  * equals is slow. IOW first check the hamming value, if that does not match, it cannot be equal. If it does match
  * resort to slower comparison.
  * - When creating neighbors I use the fact that there is going to be an incremental change to the manhattan distance
  * and do not recompute it from scratch. Hint: use a private constructor, that takes the manhattan distance as a param.
  * - Sorted the neighbors so that the most promising is delivered first. Gave a modest performance boost because
  * fewer nodes were then added to the queue in the long run.
  * - Used System.arraycopy(src, 0, target, 0,length); to copy the internal blocks array.
